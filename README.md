# Lithology-prediction-for-oil-and-gas
This project  is to create a model that predicts the lithology of the logged well from well logging data.
This solution will eliminate the human errors in interpretations, time, cost and efforts.
The current solution is done by engineers interpretation and some softwares that may be not easy to use.
This problem will be supervised / offline / classification.
The performance will be measured by confusion matrix and classification report.
The accuracy have to be high to be accepted.
NOTE: the data was collected through 118 wells from Nurwegian North sea.
